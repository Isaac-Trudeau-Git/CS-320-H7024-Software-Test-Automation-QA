Q.How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

A. I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by using testing to validate the functionality and make sure that any cases in which the code can fail are caught before releasing it. Using best practices and being aware of the quality in which the code is created while sticking to the requirements can help me to identify issues and rectify them accordingly. 

Q.How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

A. I interpret user needs by identifying and then breaking them down into smaller requirements that can be used as a verification template. Incorporating them into the program from the verification template and making sure that each step makes sense and addressed the requirement as it was meant. If there was ever any question on ambiguous requirements I would make sure that communication on a more detailed plan would take place before going forward. 

Q.How do I approach designing software?

A. My approach to designing software is structured and focused on understanding the problem and outlining the requirements. I also want to identify any potential issues that may arise. Making sure that best practices are used and understanding how code interactions will affect the system as a whole is important.
